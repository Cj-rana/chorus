Notes for a chorus

Modulation is used in music by periodically changing the pitch or amplitude of the voice or instrument
Modulation rates are typically around 5Hz
effects can be introduced in a synthesis process using an LFO
Vibrato: modulate a delay line
Chorus is blend of dry and wet, wet being vibrato.
Pitch and duration changes are obtained when playing samples at different speeds
A similar effect is obtained by dynamically changing the delay time in a delay effect
y[n] = x[n − M[n]]
If M[n] increases, the resulting pitch (or frequencies) decreases, and vice-versa
For vibrato simulation, a low frequency oscillator (LFO) is used to modulate the delay time around a central value.
M[n] = M0 + Acos(2πfnTs)
The amplitude of the LFO controls the depth (maximum pitch deviation) and the frequency the speed of modulation.
Delay time ranges are larger (e.g. 30ms)
Minimum delay time does not get as close to 0
Bipolar LFO
