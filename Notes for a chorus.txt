Notes for a chorus

Modulation is used in music by periodically changing the pitch or amplitude of the voice or instrument
Modulation rates are typically around 5Hz
effects can be introduced in a synthesis process using an LFO
Vibrato: modulate a delay line
Chorus is blend of dry and wet, wet being vibrato.
Pitch and duration changes are obtained when playing samples at different speeds
A similar effect is obtained by dynamically changing the delay time in a delay effect
y[n] = x[n − M[n]]
If M[n] increases, the resulting pitch (or frequencies) decreases, and vice-versa
For vibrato simulation, a low frequency oscillator (LFO) is used to modulate the delay time around a central value.
M[n] = M0 + Acos(2πfnTs)
The amplitude of the LFO controls the depth (maximum pitch deviation) and the frequency the speed of modulation.
Delay time ranges are larger (e.g. 30ms)
Minimum delay time does not get as close to 0
Bipolar LFO

To convert Seconds to samples:

Fs=44100

timeSec=1.5

timeSamples=Fs*timeSec 


To convert milliSeconds to samples:

timeMs=300

Then convert to seconds

timeSec=timeMs/1000

timeSamples=Fs*timeSec

As an example, consider a sine-wave LFO based on the following function:
3 ·sin(2 · π ·f ·t) +5
Here, the amplitude of the sine wave is offset, such that it is oscillating with an amplitude
range centered around a value of 5. Therefore, this LFO could be used to create a delay time
centered around 5 samples (or could be converted to other time units, 5 milliseconds or
5 seconds). The amplitude of the sine wave increases to a maximum of 8 and decreases to a
minimum of 2. As the amplitude changes, this can be used to change the delay time between
8 samples and 2 samples. Typically, the frequency, f , of the LFO for musical effects can range
from 0.1–10 Hz.
