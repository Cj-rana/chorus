: mono output
no vibrato mode (Only 50/50 mix)

Before and after the BBD delay action, there are some stages needed to avoid signal degradation:
Pre/De-Emphasis and Anti-Aliasing/Reconstruction filters.

delay times are around 5.12 to 51.2ms


Triangle LFO waveform

With Rate control at maximum position, the oscillation frequency is 3.57Hz, Min is 0.357Hz

The LFO is implemented using a dual op-amp TL022 in cascade

The rate control drives the triangle wave speed, whilst depth drives the amplitude
