: mono output
no vibrato mode (Only 50/50 mix)

Before and after the BBD delay action, there are some stages needed to avoid signal degradation:
Pre/De-Emphasis and Anti-Aliasing/Reconstruction filters.

delay times are around 5 to 50ms

LFO oscillating frequencies are up to 20Hz.

Triangle LFO waveform

With Rate control at maximum position, the oscillation frequency is 3.5Hz
